# How to donate #

Telemask is a distributed application project that integrates truly decentralized communication and Multi Chain cold payment. It has no central communication server or central wallet server, allows client app to directly access blockchain nodes, and allows connection to distributed routing services constructed by third-party participants. Telemask does not collect and disseminate personal information such as IP address, hardware parameters and wallet private key, and is committed to protecting customer privacy from infringement. Telemask has no pre excavation, private placement or public offering, and is open and transparent, all of which are generated by mining.

As a community autonomy project, telemask is driven by the support of all parties. After negotiation by the telemask development team, we now accept global donations. The donations will be used for system development and operation, enhancing customer experience, and docking with exchanges, third-party wallets, public chains and other support. A certain amount of TMS will be given to the donors who meet certain conditions.
