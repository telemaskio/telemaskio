### About Donation Airdrop ###

Telemask accepted the global donation in the early stage, and the donors who reached a certain amount of donation will air drop the governance token to show their gratitude. These airdrop tokens will enter into the frozen contract. When Telemask governance goes online, you can withdraw 10% to your public chain account, and the rest will be released linearly by block within 2 years.

If your donation reaches 3000USDT, 5000TMS will be airdropped to you, and the first 100 different donation accounts will receive this award.  
If your donation reaches 20000USDT, 50000TMS will be airdropped to you (including the airdrop Award for donation of 3000usdt). The first 20 different donation accounts will receive this airdrop award.

When you donate, you must write an email to us, write down the donation information below, so that we can register and contact you to provide the public chain account of airdrop reward.
